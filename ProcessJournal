#Initial plans for gameplay
- 2-4 player local multiplayer racing game
- Gameplay switches between two modes: racing around the track, and placing towers/traps
- Players collect resource (Gears) to be able to build objects during placement mode. Gears can be lost while racing if they collide
  with traps or walls or other players
